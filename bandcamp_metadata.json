After wandering in North Africa and South India, he now plunges his roots into the depth of African animist voodoo, within the realm of supernatural entities that strive to experiment human nature through the Stambeli ritual\n\nStambeli is a Tunisian musical therapeutic ritual that was implanted by afro-descendant communities. During the ceremonies, music, dance and chants are blended so as for some participants to reach the alternate state of trance while they are possessed by super natural entities.\n\nIt is a syncretism between Islam and animist Yorisha religion’s voodoo beliefs, that has been disseminated during slave trade by Yoruba populations originating from current Benin’s gulf. Stambeli is a precious legacy the symbolizes the outstanding diversity and complexity of the North-African identity.\n\nAt times where technology inexorably infuses into humankind, Ammar808’s next adventures lays within the realms of Stambeli’s invisible creatures, an old genuine Tunisian tradition that has roots spreading out within the depths of the African continent.\n\nUsing drum machines and analog synthesizers, he...  more",

Today, Kwenza finally steps into the spotlight with his brand-new single: SERRER LES LÊKÊS!\nAfter a groundbreaking encounter with the legendary European producer O.B.F on the track “Abidjan”, followed by two international releases (Brazil/France), the artist known as “La Polyvalence” — a nickname earned from his many talents — is coming in strong with an explosive EP on Blanc Manioc, a label praised for building daring bridges between West Africa and Europe.\nKwenza is reviving coupé-décalé from the ashes, much like Fior 2 Bior, while blending it with Caribbean bouyon, shaking up amapiano, finding the perfect melody for each finely-crafted hook, and delivering a dynamic flow that carries every track.",

Crafted between Berlin, Leeds, Paris, and Lisbon, the 14-track record is his most personal work to date; a manifesto for the way he sees\nmusic and himself. Channeling grief, family trauma, and seismic life shifts, SickElixir expands on the sounds of his recent EPs - BouQ, Dismantled Into Juice, and Woke Up Right Handed - plunging listeners into a\nchaotic yet meticulous sonic world that reflects on the past while projecting a bold vision for the future.\n\nJamie Roberts has been revered in electronic circles for years as an artist with a fastidious approach to creating his own sound, relentlessly drawing from his teenage influences growing up in Barnsley, a post-\nindustrial town in South Yorkshire. At 14, he started working on a maggot farm and credits the clanging sound of the farm’s industrial mincer as an early influence on his music. After playing in various metal bands,\nRoberts’ musical horizons began to expand through visits to the West Indian Centre in Leeds, where he was introduced to the full spectrum of electronic music. He first emerged as Blawan at the...  more",

    "description": "Emma-Jean Thackray, the visionary producer, composer, and multi-instrumentalist, today announces her highly anticipated second album, “Weirdo”, set for release on April 25th via Gilles Peterson’s celebrated record label Brownswood Recordings / Parlophone Records. Known for defying musical boundaries, Thackray's latest work is a deeply personal and utterly original exploration of selfhood, grief, and gratitude.\n\nDrawing on an eclectic mix of influences—grunge, pop, soul, p-funk, and jazz— “Weirdo” is a triumphant celebration of survival and individuality. Written, performed, recorded, mixed, produced and arranged entirely by Thackray in her South London flat, the album stands as a testament to her extraordinary musicianship and fearless self-expression.\n\nThe brand new single “Wanna Die” is a striking blend of frenetic energy and emotional vulnerability. With its scattered, uptempo beat driving the track forward, the song juxtaposes its rhythmically playful foundation against poignant reflections on mortality and resilience. Thackray’s lyrics wrestle with heavy themes, moving between moments of despair and determination. The result is an audacious exploration of life’s fragility, delivered with raw honesty...  more",

    "description": "The soul-disco melding duo and kings of modern electronica, Franc Moody, headed by Ned Franc and Jon Moody, release their newest album, Chewing The Fat. This new record is an expansion on the group’s funk-infused disco relics, maintaining their furiously fun baselines and choruses, but getting grittier in sound.\n\nChewing The Fat is a celebration of a new era for the band, which was originally energised by a couple of inspiring veteran live performances from LCD Soundsystem and Massive Attack that demonstrated that it’s not about age or experience, but attitude. They quite literally chewed the fat, stripping back their quintessential disco sheen and opting for a grittier, more guttural approach. They’ve done this without forsaking the core aesthetic of the group, its ability to produce those anthemic hooks, while delivering some truly lovely 10cc-style backing vocals and string-lines courtesy of those delightfully malfunctioning Russian synths, courtesy of the Damon Albarn broom cupboard. “Chewing The Fat felt apt as a name as it took us a lot of discourse and trial and error to find our groove with the songs and sound.” Ned remarks.\n\nNed details further, summing it up beautifully. “Life is really like a series of changes and you can either embrace it and step into the unknown full of heart and bravery and plough fresh new pastures...  more",

    "description": "To celebrate 100 years of the Theremin, Gaudi has created an album of Theremin infused dub, with precious contribuitions by some of his friends and collaborators.\n\nDeveloped in 1920 by Russian physicist Léon Theremin, the Theremin is an electronic device which works with magnetic fields and consists of one metal antenna controlled without physical contact. Predominantly a fairly niche instrument, it has featured in several styles of music since its creation, from classical works to sci-fi movie soundtracks, pop and rock.\n\nGaudi was supported in this tribute by five of the world's top dub producers - Mad Professor, Adrian Sherwood, The Scientist, Dennis Bovell and Prince Fatty. All hugely respected individuals who have been representing the best of international dub production for the last 50 years, they have provided the riddims that underpin Gaudi's Theremin playing on this astonishing project.\n\nAs a solo artist, Gaudi has recorded over 20 albums, while as a producer he has hundreds of productions under his belt. In his 30 year career he has worked with legends of the reggae and electronic music worlds including Steel Pulse, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Michael Rose, Horace Andy, Michael Franti, Zion Train, Maxi Priest, The...  more",

    "description": "THEREMIN HOMAGE TO THE SMITHS (Introduction by Don Letts)\n\nTo celebrate 40 years since Gaudi attended the only concert The Smiths played in Italy, on May 14 1985 in Rome, he wanted to say Thank You in his own artistic way to the band he loved the most. No other bands or music artists has managed to stir such extreme emotions -Gaudi says-, touching my soul and my heart, artistically and personally.\nMorrissey and Marr were an untouchable combo whose songwriting and performance to G's mind was absolute perfection. Such was their musical chemistry it made it extremely difficult, if not almost impossible to cover their songs. No other singer can recreate the melancholic romanticism of Moz. His vocal delivery was intimate and distinctive, touching quarter tones that made him unique and made him, well so him.\nThat being said, Gaudi still had the desire to try the impossible by playing the only musical instrument he believed was up to the task of respectfully re-interpreting The Smiths’ musical magic and in so doing say thank you, in his very own way.\nThe Theremin, is the musical instrument on which he has specialized for 27 years now, playing it live in all his gigs and including...  more",

Here it’s re-titled ’Theremin In Hand’, with Gaudi playing the vocal line on the theremin, while Colin Edwin (of Porcupine Tree) plays bass and Horseman drums.\n\nThe track was originally going to be on the “100 Years” album, but a conversation with Adrian Sherwood while the duo were working together on Lee Perry’s “Rainford” album led them to the conclusion that it would be better to release it later as a single.\n\nOn the flip is a brand new Gaudi original, ’Theremin Memoir', which finds him channeling Serge Gainsbourg and Ennio Morricone in his homage to their 60’s and 70’s films. Colin Edwin again plays bass, with all other instruments are played by Gaudi.\n\nBoth tracks represent a continuation of the themes developed on the “100 Years” album, with Gaudi’s theremin riding the riddims in the same way that Augustus Pablo did with his melodica.

The nine-track album features six newly-composed songs inspired by themes such humanity’s connections with the natural world, ancient folklore, the persecution of witches and Shakespeare’s Henry IV, as well as fresh interpretations of much-loved Morris tunes, a modern take on a traditional murder ballad and a cover of a Paul Giovanni composition from the cinematic soundtrack to The Wickerman.\n\nShowcasing Green Diesel’s masterful distillation of folk, rock and psychedelic influences, together with their usual exemplary musicianship and trademark vocals, the album was recorded at Squarehead Studios in Newington, Kent with producer Rob Wilks (Smoke Fairies, Lianne La Havas, Story Books) once again at the helm.",

A Reimagined Classic.\nOut October 17, 2025 via Sonar Kollektiv\n\nTo continue the celebration of the 20th anniversary of In Between, Jazzanova and Sonar Kollektiv present a forward-looking reinterpretation of the original 2002 landmark release: In Between (Remixes) — a full-length remix compilation that breathes new life into the original LP’s iconic tracks.\n\nIn Between helped define the sound of nu-jazz, broken beat, and future soul. Now, over two decades later, a new generation of producers—alongside longtime collaborators—revisit the Jazzanova catalog with genre-bending approaches, fresh ears, and global perspectives.\n\nThe album features 11 brand-new remixes from a carefully curated lineup, including:\nJacana People, Eric Hilton (Thievery Corporation), The KBCS, Nautilus, DJ Slowz, Magro, Crackazat, Paskal & Urban Absolutes, Kid Fonque, Groove Chronicles, and Satin Jackets.\n\nEach remix honors the spirit of In Between while reimagining it through a different lens—ranging from deep house, nu-disco, and...  more",

This unique style fused West African melodies with synthesizers, disco, and boogie, a sound that took Ghanaian airwaves by storm in the 1980s and beyond. With previous volumes receiving strong support by tastemakers such as Gilles Peterson, Antal, Tom Ravenscroft, and Hunee, Volume 3 takes a deeper dive than ever before into the world of Ghanaian digital dance music.\n\nThis volume features rare, sought-after tracks from artists including Obibini Takyi, Osei Banahene, and Okyerema Asante, as well as Burger Highlife trailblazers George Darko and Lee Dodou. Borga Revolution! Volume 3 offers a curated mix of standout anthems and rediscovered gems, many of which are otherwise nearly impossible to find, making this collection a must-have for fans and collectors alike.\n\nThe 1970s and 80s saw Ghanaian musicians begin to incorporate Western sounds like funk and disco into their music, reflecting the changing global musical landscape. However, the country's political instability and economic hardships, marked by military regimes and curfews, forced many artists to leave Ghana in search...  more",

The Beautiful Swimmers are Ari Goldman and Andrew Field-Pickering (AKA Max D). And you, my friend, are about to get high on the happy. They’re here to take you on a gleeful joyride around their collective musical imagination.\n\nThe Swimmers are full bore record enthusiasts you see, but whereas you might associate this with squirrelly, exclusive and crabby sorts, they are inclusive, human and warm. It’s a wide-eyed ebullient romp and the joy of discovery is one to share. And to see them DJ IS a joy - they’re having at least as much fun as anyone else in the room, locked together tight, riding the same wave.\n\nSo even when shit gets somewhat darker, the tempos higher and sounds gnarlier (Analogous Doom) the world is never grey. When we’re stone cold balearic in the Adriatic (Plunky) the vibe is up, young and fun. Banging them b’more house beats?

Nothing sounded good enough, authentic enough or in line with who I aim to be as an artist.\n\nIn this period I felt like I needed to create a barrier between my club music and the music I make with the intention to just be stuff you’d like to listen to at any given moment of the day. It’s almost ironic because this way of thinking is the opposite how I am as a DJ. Perfectionism took over 90% of the time which made music making so much harder and less fun.\n\nFor the first time since I started making music I felt pressure and anxiety going forward. In a way I might’ve directed that energy towards the 6 edits I released in this period of time, including the Sade, Cleo Sol & Kendrick one. Making those felt more natural in a weird way. This period was all about healing and I’ve done just that. 🙂‍↕️\n\nSo now is the time to let go of the music I’ve been making for the past 1,5 years! We’re starting off with my new record: “Tree’s Root”. This one breathes summer and warmth. I hope you enjoy it as much as I loved making it.",

Gradually, granular tapestries took shape, weaving modal electronics with percussion, sax, flute, and DX7. The result is a low-lit patchwork of dream and delirium, fractal ambient and fifth-world freefall: Musée Des Espèces [‘Museum of Species’].\n\nBarbier’s background in new wave world-building and synth-patch sculpting fuses here to full effect. The songs are alternately soothing and serpentine, swaying with smoke, rhythm, color, and ceremony. It’s album-as-environment, a harmony of spheres and vertical terrain, swiftly tilting through a tunnel of sky, sea, and circuitry.\n\n“I wanted to create something between chaos and harmony – a naturalistic dialogue.”",

Goldie's interest in the title track set the course for an EP that draws on the roots of jungle and drum & bass while exploring its outer edges.\n\nAcross its four tracks, the EP unfolds as a journey - beginning in foggy melancholy, shifting into bittersweet, rave-charged energy, rising toward brighter, more uplifting tones and closing with an almost dreamlike sense of release. Breakbeat-heavy throughout, the 'Altitudez EP' is a release that carries the spirit of jungle into new terrain.",

Originally sparked by an invitation from Goldie in 2018 to deliver multiple releases for the label, the album gradually took on its own identity, absorbing each stage of Quartz’s shifting environments and mindset.\n\nThere has always been something quietly disquieting about the music of Quartz, also known as Elliot Garvey. Not in a theatrical sense, but more like a fog that rolls in and never quite lifts. Interloper continues that tension: textured, brooding, and deeply precise. The record doesn’t announce itself; it unfolds slowly, rewarding close attention with meticulous detail and atmosphere.\n\nGarvey’s path has always been unconventional. A Welsh producer uninterested in social media or self-promotion, he has carved out a singular presence within the underground. Respected by veterans and quietly championed by tastemakers, his work sits outside trend or scene. “I’ve always chased that looming tension,” he says. “Something that hits in a way you don’t quite expect.”\n\nUnlike many concept-driven projects, Interloper emerged organically, over years of work alongside his other releases. “I realised...  more",

    "description": "Presenting a joyous double dose of Brazilian pífano magic by João do Pife, taken from his iconic Folclore Alagoano LP and pressed for the first time on 7” vinyl. The infectious, uplifting energy of the instrumental track 'Garoto Do Pife' has been a dancefloor weapon for revered selectors such as Gilles Peterson, Cliffy and the Mr Bongo DJs, and we are proud to be reissuing it for the first time. &nbsp;\n\nThe pífano, pifaro or pife, which creates the distinctive melodies in these tracks, is a simple seven-hole woodwind instrument from the Northeast region of Brazil. Often made out of bamboo or taquara wood, they are rich in folkloric music tradition and paired with percussion instruments to form the Bandas de Pífanos groups, which originated from the Northeastern states of the country. \"Pifeiros” such as João do Pife, Edmilson do Pífano, and Carlos Malta brought the pífano into a wider public eye through their albums and vinyl recordings.\n\nA part of pífano maestro João do Pife’s rich legacy, these two mesmerizing and timeless tracks originate from his sought-after 1975 LP Folclore Alagoano, released on the Tropicana label.&nbsp;\n\nA part of pífano maestro João do Pife’s rich legacy, these two mesmerizing and timeless tracks originate from his sought...  more",

    "description": "Chwyldro is not solely a piece of music — it's an invocation. A fire lit centuries ago, passed from hand to hand through the bloodline of resistance that defines Welsh identity. From the ancient roar of the Welsh Princes, to the thunder of striking miners, to the defiant chants of the 1960s language protests, and now the growing call for independence — Wales has never stopped singing its rebellion. This land was England’s first colony, yet its soul has never been conquered. For nearly a millennium, we’ve fought — not just with fists, but with words, with song, with spirit — to keep our language and culture alive. Chwyldro channels this enduring flame, telling the tale of one such legendary uprising — the Rebecca Riots. A revolt cloaked in mystery, where farmers dressed as women rose against injustice under the banner of \"Rebecca and her Daughters.\" It was theatre. It was fury. It was music. This is the heartbeat of a people who’ve turned struggle into poetry — and revolution into rhythm.",

    "description": "'Nainan Da Pyar De Gaya' is the third and final single from Naya Beat’s reissue of an astonishing lost “holy grail” – the first British Asian electronic dance music album ever recorded – Mohinder Kaur Bhamra’s 1982 masterpiece ‘Punjabi Disco’.\n\nHot off the incredible success of her band Say She She’s third studio album ‘Cut & Rewind’, Piya Malik teams up with Naya Beat co-founders Turbotito & Ragz on a groove-laden psychedelic-tinged cover of 'Nainan Da Pyar De Gaya'. Electric saz, feedback noise, dubbed out loops, and an infectious bassline create a trippy and beautifully textured backdrop for Malik’s soaring Punjabi vocals. A dramatic breakdown and epic build take the track into anthemic fist-pumping territory. Not to be outdone, the legendary duo Psychemagik, who gave us 'Mink and Shoes' and remixes of big classics, turn the original version of 'Nainan Da Pyar De Gaya' on its head. A blistering techno-inspired remix features a pulsating mix of dark, snaking bass and drums with deep space ambience and raw hits that provides a riveting backdrop for Mohinder’s powerfully raw vocals. Psychemagik take the original into scintillating new sonic territory, a surefire dancefloor hit for those late nights.\n\nProduced by Mohinder’s eldest son and bhangra...  more",

Determined to escape violence, she entrusted smugglers to ferry her across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen and on to Saudi Arabia. Twice deported, including once to Ethiopia, Khadija persisted. In 1993, funded by Mogadishu’s legendary Waaberi Band, she boarded a cargo ship as a stowaway, beginning the third of four attempts to build a life abroad.\n\nFor Somalis of her generation, Saudi Arabia offered little beyond domestic work and janitorial labor. Khadija refused. A cherished but under-recognized voice in Mogadishu’s golden era, fronting acts like Dur Dur on stage, Khadija carried her artistry into the kingdom, where music was banned outright, and the consequences for women performers could be brutal.\n\n“Performing in Saudi Arabia was the most dangerous of...  more",

Trumpeter Cesar Apolinar Hernandez and vocalist Alya Olcan lend their voices to tracks A1 and A2, adding new layers to the sonic terrain.\n\nR.F.I. utilizes 100% analog instrumentation. It is warm.

The track started as i often do with a sample of my life, its was a day where my young kids were playing with my mum and it got me thinking about how they may not remember these moments when they grow up and how important it can be to remember not the just moment but the relationships between people in it, what they mean to each other and how they make each other feel. The excitement and pure joy of kids when they are young is a powerful thing. It brings everyone around them back to the simple pure moments they get from the simple things in life. It's how I think people often feel in a rave too, it’s something music does for so many people; it transports us to another place mentally where we can shut out the world and let go in a way that I saw that day in the simple amazement of Raffy chasing bubbles. So, in a way Bubbles is simply about letting ourselves feel like we are 2 years old chasing bubbles x",

The Sanders clan grew up singing together in the Witness of Jesus Christ church in Fresno CA, where dad Marion was pastor. Guitarist Larry Price–who belonged to neither family–completed the line-up that recorded the group’s first–and, prophetically, only–album, It’ll All Be Over.\n\nReleased in 1980 on the group’s own S&K (Sanders & Kingsby) label, It’ll All Be Over pinpoints a fatalistic mood exemplified by the title. Its lyrics drawn from the Old Testament, its sound from the church by way of the disco, and it’s a feel captured by the album cover–a low, orange sun setting over the Pacific ocean. It is, as Jessica Hundley observes in the brand new liner notes, “both apocalyptic and seductive.”\n\nMaking the album was not easy. Sessions began in Trac...  more",

The compilation comprises many producers making their Tectonic debut, including re:ni, Beatrice M., Yushh, Flora Yin Wong, and Sicaria, alongside stalwarts like 2562, Shed, and Distance. It’s an exhilarating 24-track journey through experimental, bass-heavy electronic music, with almost all tracks created by the artists specifically with Tectonic’s sound in mind - at an intersection where dubstep and techno meet.\n\n\"More so than just the sound, the music is in tune with the real ethos of the early dubstep scene. People talk about ‘heads in a scene - but it’s led by hearts really. I’ve always tried to follow my heart when it comes to music and all the music here is from people I trust to do something worth communicating with the world. It feels like Tectonic has been a part of many communities over the years, and there is something that binds all the releases together, something that speaks for itself in a way that goes beyond words, something that’s instinctive and immediate.”",

Wielding a nifty set of disco scissors, he's selected the finest of gospel cuts and brought them neatly to the boil, serving up three delectable dishes of hot spiritual gumbo. Soul food of the highest calibre.\n\nTaking us to church straight off the bat, 'Thankful' builds and builds along an infectiously uplifting piano-heavy hook; an edit that bubbles away effortlessly akin to a Moodyman-esque disco groove, perfectly crafted for the dancefloor.\n\n'He'll Answer' drops the tempo and tone to something slower & lower, lending its sound to that of the most proficient beat-masters, incorporating moody synths and haunting strings, in a true future gospel style and pattern.\n\nThe last serving on the plate is 'Jus' A Little Talk' – a cheeky flip of a classic that's destined to make the AOR diggers and connoisseurs salivate profusely. This retro yacht rock bumper closes out this joyously ethereal platter perfectly.\n\nAlready finding its way into the crates of selectors such as Gilles Peterson, Horse Meat Disco and Patrick Forge, it's also received love in Mixmag and across the airwaves, from NTS to Mi-Soul to Rinse FM.\n\nAnother essential Excursion on wax, and one that will never leave the box.",

Four more dishes of hot spiritual gumbo for your mind, body & soul.\n\nOnce again The Showfa has expertly cut together a concoction of gospel, soul, disco, latin, jazz, funk, and spiritual rhythm & blues. The glorious disco rework of a track called ‘Amazing’ sets the tone with an infectious piano riff and powerfully uplifting vocal. ’Surely Surely’ follows, with a more vigorous strut; a short, sweet slice of disco funk, no messing about. ’Praising’ keeps the groove and tempo solidly in a delicious eighties boogie formation, slap bass and sax in tow. The set closes out with beautiful latin-jazz tinged vibrations sauntering through ‘I’ll Show You The Way’, before switching to the sweetest sweet soul you ever did hear. Soul food of the highest calibre.\n\nThe previous volume was shown love last year by an assortment of selectors and tastemakers, including Tony Humphries, Horse Meat Disco, Gilles Peterson, Craig Charles, BBC 6Music, Mi-Soul, Rinse FM and Mixmag, and also saw The Showfa spinning on the airwaves on NTS with Charlie Bones, and for Wax Poetics.\n\nAnother joyously ethereal platter, and another one that will never leave the box.",
